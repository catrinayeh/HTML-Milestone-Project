            Hello. I am Japnit. I am the founder of the Go Girl Organisation. My goal for this organisation is to inspire girls to discover and pursue programming through our fun and friendly workshops in Python, HTML, and CSS. So, I hope you are having a great time and learning a lot about programming! An interesting fact me is that I have done a TEDx Talk on Challenging Gender Bias in Technology. As you can see from the trend, I hope to instill confidence in young girls to stand tall and unapologetically in an industry dominated by men.
