            Hello. I am Japnit. I am the <b>founder of the Go Girl Organisation</b>. My goal for this organisation is to inspire girls to discover and pursue programming through our fun and friendly workshops in Python, HTML, and CSS. So, I hope you are having a great time and learning a lot about programming! An interesting fact me is that I have done a TEDx Talk on <i>Challenging Gender Bias in Technology</i>. As you can see from the trend, I hope to instill confidence in young girls to stand tall and unapologetically in an industry dominated by men.
